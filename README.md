# lodash for Backbone

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mohsen1/lodash-for-backbone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mohsen1/lodash-for-backbone)

A cherry-picked collection of [`lodash`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) methods that is required for backbone. This collection is ~0.5kb smaller than Underscore itself.

If you're only including Underscore for Backbone, by replacing this module with Underscore you save around half a kilobyte.

### Usage

Replace the [`browser.min.js`](./browser.min.js) file with your `underscore.js` file in your browser.


### Build
run `npm run build` to make a new build.
